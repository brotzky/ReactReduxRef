# ReactReduxRef
This project started from ReduxSimpleStarter: https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter

###Purpose###
This repository is a personal reference for React using Redux. This is my progress following React Redux course https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/ by Stephen Grider. I am aiming to fully grasp Redux and all the concepts it brings along with it - reducers, actions, pure functions, middleware, and a single object for state.
